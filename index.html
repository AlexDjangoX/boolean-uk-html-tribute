          Salvador Dalí, in full Salvador Felipe Jacinto Dalí y Domenech, (born
          May 11, 1904, Figueras, Spain—died January 23, 1989, Figueras),
          Spanish Surrealist painter and printmaker, influential for his
          explorations of subconscious imagery. As an art student in Madrid and
          Barcelona, Dalí assimilated a vast number of artistic styles and
          displayed unusual technical facility as a painter.

          It was not until the late 1920s, however, that two events brought
          about the development of his mature artistic style: his discovery of
          Sigmund Freud’s writings on the erotic significance of subconscious
          imagery and his affiliation with the Paris Surrealists, a group of
          artists and writers who sought to establish the “greater reality” of
          the human subconscious over reason.

          Once Dalí hit on that method, his painting style matured with
          extraordinary rapidity, and from 1929 to 1937 he produced the
          paintings which made him the world’s best-known Surrealist artist. He
          depicted a dreamworld in which commonplace objects are juxtaposed,
          deformed, or otherwise metamorphosed in a bizarre and irrational
          fashion. Dalí portrayed those objects in meticulous, almost painfully
          realistic detail and usually placed them within bleak sunlit
          landscapes that were reminiscent of his Catalonian homeland. Perhaps
          the most famous of those enigmatic images is The Persistence of Memory
          (1931), in which limp melting watches rest in an eerily calm
          landscape.
